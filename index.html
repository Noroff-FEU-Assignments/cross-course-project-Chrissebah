    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">-I would strongly advise a client to set up a dedicated proactive security team, who work to ensure that all security for the website is up to date. There are several ways that this team can ensure that the security is as good as it can be.  
        
        Firstly, they should adopt a cybersecurity framework. This means that all security is set up with a strategic approach, which begins by running detailed research on security risks and making an incident response plan. 
        
        Another thing they can do is automate and integrate security tools. This would mean that there would be less manual labor, and a smaller chance for errors. 
        
        A crucial step to take is to make sure that there are no errors when writing code, to make sure that the foundations are as solid as possible. 
        
        Using a diverse amount of security measures can help make sure that the site is as secure as possible. This is because it ensures that many different forms of attacks are accounted for. 
        
        Finally, having the team perform security exercises often will help ensure that the security measures are as up to date and trustworthy as possible.
